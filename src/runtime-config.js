/**
 * Runtime configuration — persistent feature toggles that can be flipped from
 * the dashboard at runtime without a restart or editing .env. Backed by a
 * small JSON file next to the project root so it survives redeploys.
 *
 * Currently hosts the "experimental" feature flags. Keep this tiny: anything
 * that needs a restart should stay in config.js / .env.
